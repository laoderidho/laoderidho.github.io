   Ridho's childhood was very happy and had a dream to become a train engineer, but unfortunately his parents did not support him and only told him to go to college instead of becoming a machinist, from there Ridho became a student at the Adventist University of Indonesia majoring in Informatics Engineering and stories. He is assembling the future at the start
  During elementary and junior high school, Ridho was also quite successful. When he graduated from elementary school he won 3rd place in his school and when he was in junior high school he won 1st place in class up to high school. He participated in a quiz competition at the sub-district level and won 1st place
   High school was also a slightly bleak period for Ridho because of a problem that his teachers often brought up during high school and made him frustrated which made his achievement decline, but when he was in college, the words from the teachers that frustrated him became a motivation for him. and when he is lazy in college, those words make him more diligent

                In a lecture in Informatics Engineering, Ridho often finds it difficult to study because he missed a lesson in high school, but all he can do is get through it and get satisfactory grades for him.
  Maybe other people can say that his value is below standard but even so Ridho is proud to get value from his own efforts and will develop in the future
Ridho in Informatics engineering he prefers to like website developers and becomes a full stack developer, his work during the 3rd semester project lecture yesterday on websites also got a good score and became the first website project he made
  His message is that in life he is happy even though he is still in college but continues to do his best so that in the future he can become a useful person for himself and others.

ridho has a dream until old age to have developments in the IT world and become a website developer and can develop his own website
